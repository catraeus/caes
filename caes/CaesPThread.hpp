/*
    A c++ wrapper to get pthread to work.  I know that boost is coming to standard c but venerable
      pthread does a fine job and goes directly to the kernel.
    The pattern is that this interface definer should never be instantiated.  Instead ... a derived
      class will have any level of functionality but be able to have a function implememted.  If
      we really need to have complex functionality on many levels, then this can be used
      as a pattern for a class that isn't derived.  After all ... the static function can be as
      manifold as needed.
    WARNING:
      I don't know how thread-safe a static function is ... is it duplicated by the OS or the
      compiler?  If it isn't ever duplicated, then there is the re-entrant problem all over again
      more times.  In classical function instantiation, without threads, the calling context ...
      the "Entry" static function below ... stays in context to pop back out.
