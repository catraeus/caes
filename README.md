# caesbase
I like having things my way.<br>
I trust that long long is 64 bits and int is 32 bits<br>
etc. etc.<br>
I make <my_caes_root>  at /way/dev/SW<br>
I have "way" instead of, maybe, /dev or /projects because "way" has a zen-like ring to it and development is a "way" isn't it?<br>
Put this at <your_caes_root>/caeslib<br>
There should be <your_caes_root>/apps/signals  etc. etc. that draw on this library.
